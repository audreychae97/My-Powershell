# My-Powershell
Just a place for me to practice and improve PowerShell!

A PowerShell script that connects to my outlook calendar to check for upcoming events and meetings. The desired time frame for events can be changed as well. 
Every morning at 8AM, the script runs and alerts to my Slack channel the events I have for that day! 

This project was inspired by the automation scripts my Team at T-Mobile was writing.
