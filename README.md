# My-Powershell
A powershell script that connects to the user's Outlook account to view the calendar events and meetings. Pulls the data for a specified amount of day(s), and sends a notification to my Slack channel. 

The script is called when my computer re-boots in the morning, or every morning at 8AM. 

This project was inspired by the automation scripts my Team at T-Mobile was writing.
